## 1 Foreword
The Atlanta Iron Yard's internal Hackathon was an absolute blast to participate in. We would like to say a huge "Thank you!" to the people at Soltech who gave up their time to come check out what we were up to and also to judge the winners. On the iOS side, I want to personally thank my teammate Ebony for being awesome. I also want to thank my other teammates Alex, Vedika and Rachel. We did as best as we could!

## 3 What we learned
On the iOS side, we learned a lot more about API calls and processing the return data. We also had more experience with MapKit, singletons, and communicating as a group between front end, back end, and mobile. 

Some short comings that we faced were not being in sync with what we each needed from each other. I think on our planning time during Friday evening and night, we didn't all get on the same page but rather just threw up a really rough outline with what we needed and got to programming. 

Another thing I think we could improve on is estimating the time necessary to implement certain features. Some features seemed "easy" to implement, but in reality, there needs to be more time devoted to completely have them at full functionality. Overall project time management was something that we needed more experience with. On the morning of the last day before we presented, we realized we didn't have enough time to implement all features required. As a result, some of our dummy data is hard coded in so we could have a presentable presentation to showcase what we were intending to implement.

Overall, this was an incredibly valuable experience which combined developers from all the cohorts in a time constrained setting. I wish we could've implemented more, but I'm proud of what we were able to accomplish, and most importantly, we learned valuable experience in attempting to create a minimum viable product.
